# Project 1 - Number Guessing Game
In this project, we will prompt the user for a range of numbers. Then, we will generate a random integer within that range, and prompt the user for their guess. The goal of the game is to guess the random integer generated with the least amount of guessess. The range will change based on what the user guesses. If the range is from 1 to 100 and the random integer is 42, and if the user guesses 50, we will output "Your guess is too big! Try again!" And repeat the process till the number is guessed in the least amount of guesses. 

Made it my own by allowing the user to try to guess it in the least amount of guesses not based of algorithm.
